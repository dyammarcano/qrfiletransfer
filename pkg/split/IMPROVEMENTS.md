# Split Package Improvements

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to the split package to enhance code quality, maintainability, and robustness.

## Improvements

### 1. Code Organization and Documentation
- Added comprehensive package-level documentation explaining the purpose and functionality
- Added detailed function documentation for all exported functions with parameters and return values
- Improved documentation for internal helper functions
- Added explanatory comments for complex logic sections
- Improved documentation for the commented-out code intended for future extensions

### 2. Error Handling
- Enhanced error messages with more descriptive context
- Used proper error wrapping with `fmt.Errorf` and `%w` verb to preserve error chains
- Added checks for additional edge cases:
  - Empty chunk lists
  - Missing first chunk
  - Empty data to decode
  - Invalid chunk indexes
- Improved error handling in helper functions

### 3. Resource Management
- Ensured consistent use of defer statements for resource cleanup
- Fixed nested error handling in the MergeFile function
- Added explicit file closing to release resources sooner when possible
- Improved error handling during file operations

### 4. Code Readability
- Defined constants for magic numbers:
  - `DefaultFilePermissions` (0644)
  - `DefaultDirPermissions` (0755)
  - `MinChunks` (2)
  - `MaxFilenameLength` (46)
- Improved variable naming for clarity (e.g., `blob` â†’ `encodedData`)
- Added section comments to break up complex functions
- Simplified the Split struct by removing unused fields

### 5. Robustness
- Added validation for input parameters
- Improved handling of edge cases in data splitting and merging
- Added proper error handling for previously ignored errors
- Enhanced the success message in MergeFile to include the output filename

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: The improved documentation and code organization make the package easier to understand and maintain.

2. **Reliability**: Better error handling and edge case coverage make the code more robust and less prone to unexpected failures.

3. **Debuggability**: More descriptive error messages make it easier to diagnose issues when they occur.

4. **Readability**: Constants, better variable names, and explanatory comments make the code more readable and easier to follow.

5. **Resource Efficiency**: Improved resource management ensures files are closed properly and resources are released promptly.

## Verification
All tests have been run and pass successfully, confirming that the improvements haven't broken any functionality.
