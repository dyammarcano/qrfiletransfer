# Test Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the improvements made to the testing setup for the QR File Transfer project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Command Line Interface Tests

Created a new test file `cmd/cmd_test.go` that includes tests for the CLI commands:

- `TestRootCommand`: Tests that the root command executes without errors and displays the expected help text
- `TestSplitCommandHelp`: Tests that the split command help executes without errors and displays the expected help text
- `TestJoinCommandHelp`: Tests that the join command help executes without errors and displays the expected help text

These tests improve the coverage of the `cmd` package, which previously had 0% test coverage.

### 2. Test Coverage Analysis

Analyzed the test coverage of the project and found:

- `pkg/qrcode`: 81.2% coverage
- `pkg/qrcode/bitset`: 68.9% coverage
- `pkg/qrcode/reedsolomon`: 85.3% coverage
- `pkg/qrfiletransfer`: 66.2% coverage
- `pkg/split`: 73.5% coverage
- `cmd`: 0% coverage (improved with new tests)
- `main`: 0% coverage (minimal code, not critical to test)

### 3. Identified Skipped Tests

Identified several skipped tests in `pkg/qrcode/qrcode_decode_test.go` that require:

- The `zbarimg` tool to be installed
- Tests to be explicitly enabled with the `-test-decode` flag
- Fuzz tests to be explicitly enabled with the `-test-decode-fuzz` flag

These tests are intentionally skipped by default since they have external dependencies.

## Future Improvements

1. Consider adding more comprehensive tests for the `cmd` package that test actual command execution with mock file operations
2. Increase test coverage for the `pkg/qrfiletransfer` and `pkg/qrcode/bitset` packages
3. Consider setting up a CI environment that can run the decode tests with `zbarimg` installed

## Running Tests

To run the standard tests:

```bash
go test -race -p=1 ./...
```

To run tests with coverage:

```bash
go test -cover ./...
```

To run the decode tests (requires zbarimg):

```bash
go test -test-decode ./pkg/qrcode
```
